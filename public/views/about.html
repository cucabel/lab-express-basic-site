        Joe Biden is an American politician serving as the 46th and current
        president of the United States. A member of the Democratic Party, he

        Raised in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and New Castle County, Delaware, Biden
        studied at the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from
        Syracuse University in 1968. He was elected to the New Castle County
        Council in 1970 and became the sixth-youngest senator in American
        history when he was elected to the U.S. Senate from Delaware in 1972, at
        the age of 29. Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign
        Relations Committee and eventually became its chairman. He also chaired
        the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1987 to 1995, dealing with drug
        policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties issues; led the effort to
        pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence
        Against Women Act; and oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation
        hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and
        Clarence Thomas. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential
        nomination in 1988 and again in 2008.
